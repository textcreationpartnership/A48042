            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving for some Days resided in this City, I came to understand that there happened a Strange and wonderful Birth, about an hour and a half, or a <hi>Dutch</hi> Mile, from this place, in a Dorp called <hi>Clems,</hi> or rather <hi>Clements Church.</hi> Yesterday I walked thither in Company with several others, and found it answerable to the Relation I heard, viz. That they are two Daughters, well Shap'd and perfect in all their Members, onely they are joyned together, at the top of the head, and so fast that it seems to be but one head.
<pb facs="tcp:104292:2"/>Yet it is apparent both heads have their perfect faculties: and a partition may be easily selt, which I felt my self yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: But yet several Doctors and Chyrurgeons from <hi>Bridges,</hi> haveing been there, to see whether the Children might be parted without danger of death, find no probability. The Father is called <hi>Roelan Voyoen,</hi> being by Trade a Wagonmaker, of about 23 Years of age: The Mothers name is <hi>Maria Castelmans,</hi> about 19 Years old. She was delivered of these two Children (being her first-born on the sixth of this Moneth, being Ascension day (so called) about two a Clock in the Morning: they are both baptized, and the one named <hi>Pieternella,</hi> the other <hi>Barbara.</hi> That they are distinct in life, soul and brains, appear plainly from the actions which they have, both together, and sometimes apart: for the one often sleeps, while the other is awake, Cryes and eats: and they are ofenttimes both awake, and both eating: I have seen them both asleep, and both awake, and one asleep, and the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake. The Heads are so united together, that when that which is awake turns it self, the Neck of the other turns also: They will never be able to go, sit, or stand: for if the one should sit, or stand upright, the other must stand on her Head, with the Heels upward: Their Face, Nose, and Eyes, are not directly opposite to one another, but somewhat sideways, so as that one looks toward you, and the other from you. Many People come daily to see them, and give 3 <hi>Stivers</hi> apiece: Their Parents are offered a great Sum of Money for them to be carried about: They told us, they did intend (after the Holy Days, so called) to carry their Children to <hi>Bridges,</hi> and it may be from thence to the Cities of <hi>Holland.</hi>
